# Recolor
It was a university project given to us as introduction to programming and different tools,
link to C project.
I decided to recode the same game on Unity for fun and learning purposes.

# Goal 
It's a small game where you are given a number of tiles of different colors,
your goal is to recolor all of them in the same color.

To do that you are able to change the color of the tile on the top left corner by clicking on any tile that has a different color.
By doing this all the tiles that are neighbors to the top left corner tile and have the same color  will then be recolored.

Neighbors here only include:
    - top
    - left
    - right
    - down
